        <h2>My Role Model Is Model</h2>
        
        <p> My Role Model is my mom. She is my role model because she taught me everything I know. She is the reasons why my siblings and I do not have to want for nothing. She made sure that we always had a roof over our head. My mom always put us before everything even herself. I love my mom with my whole heart and i know she loves us the same. She pushed me to be better and not give up. She wants us to be better than her. She inspired me to become the first generaton graduate. My mom is the one that was there threw all the anxiety attacks and meltdowns. She was always there and will forever be there for me and others. She has the biggest heart there is. Sometimes her heart can be to big. After saying these things this is why my mom is my role model.
